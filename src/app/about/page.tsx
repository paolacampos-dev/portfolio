            </h1>

            <p className="mb-4">
                I am a junior front-end developer and web designer with strong HTML and CSS fundamentals with a natural eye for clean, intuitive interfaces. I enjoy building visually balanced layouts that feel atractive, responsive, and purposeful, especially single-page experiences and landing-style designs.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Currently, I am at the final stage of a software development bootcamp, where I have been consolidating my front-end foundations while implementing modern tools and frameworks in real projects. This portfolio is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and reflects the latest techniques learned, applied with a strong focus on structure, performance, and accessibility.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Alongside design and layout, my motivation is to understand how applications work end-to-end— from logic and data flow to deployment. While my main professional focus is front-end and UI, I am also building solid back-end foundations with Node.js, APIs, and databases.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Before moving into tech, I worked in teaching and people-focused roles, which strengthened my communication skills, adaptability, and attention to detail. I bring that same mindset into development: breaking problems down, staying organised, and refining until the solution feels right.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this stage, I am looking for a junior front-end or web design role where I can contribute to real products, continue learning, and grow within a collaborative team.
